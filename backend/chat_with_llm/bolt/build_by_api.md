# Possible API 

Below is a representative set of back-end API endpoints you might need for a typical **financial news monitoring + AI analysis + human override** system. This list is **not** definitive—your exact needs will differ based on your system’s requirements, but it’s a useful starting point.

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

1. **POST** `/api/auth/register`  
   - Register a new user (if your system allows self-registration or user management).  
   - **Body**: `{ username, password, email, ... }`  
   - **Response**: newly created user info, or error.

2. **POST** `/api/auth/login`  
   - Authenticate user credentials.  
   - **Body**: `{ username, password }`  
   - **Response**: `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, user info, or error.

3. **POST** `/api/auth/refresh`  
   - Issue a new access token using a refresh token.  
   - **Body**: `{ refreshToken }`  
   - **Response**: new `accessToken` (and optionally a new `refreshToken`).

4. **POST** `/api/auth/logout` (or **DELETE** `/api/auth/logout`)  
   - Invalidate the user’s token or remove the refresh token from the DB.  

*(Depending on your security approach, you might track tokens server-side or rely purely on JWT checks.)*

---

## 2. User Management

If you have multiple roles (admin, analyst, viewer, etc.), you’ll need endpoints for user CRUD and role assignments:

1. **GET** `/api/users`  
   - Return a list of users.  
   - **Query parameters**: `role`, `status`, pagination details, etc.

2. **GET** `/api/users/:id`  
   - Return details for a specific user.

3. **POST** `/api/users`  
   - Create a new user (by an admin or manager role).  
   - **Body**: user profile info, roles.

4. **PUT** `/api/users/:id` (or **PATCH** for partial updates)  
   - Update user info (role changes, name changes, etc.).

5. **DELETE** `/api/users/:id`  
   - Delete or deactivate a user.

*(If you’re handling user management externally, e.g., corporate SSO or LDAP, you may not need these.)*

---

## 3. Financial News Items

These endpoints manage the raw or partially processed news articles that come in from your data ingestion pipeline:

1. **GET** `/api/news`  
   - Returns a list of news items.  
   - **Query parameters**: e.g., `dateRange`, `keyword`, `assetSymbol`, `sentiment`, pagination, etc.

2. **GET** `/api/news/:id`  
   - Returns details for a specific news item (headline, summary, relevant assets, original source link, etc.).

3. **POST** `/api/news`  
   - Create a new news item (optionally used by your ingestion pipeline or if you want to insert test data).  
   - **Body**: news content, metadata, tags.

4. **PUT** `/api/news/:id` (or **PATCH**)  
   - Update the metadata for a news item (e.g., if you need to fix a headline or re-tag an article).  
   - Could also handle user overrides of textual data (like headline corrections).

5. **DELETE** `/api/news/:id`  
   - Remove a news item from the system if needed.

---

## 4. AI Analysis Data

Since each news item is run through an AI pipeline (for sentiment, entity extraction, event detection, etc.), you’ll need ways to retrieve and update the analysis results:

1. **GET** `/api/analysis`  
   - Retrieves a list of analysis entries.  
   - You could tie this directly to news items (one-to-one or one-to-many relationship).  
   - **Query parameters**: `newsId`, `dateRange`, `sentimentRange`, etc.

2. **GET** `/api/analysis/:id`  
   - Return details of a specific analysis record (e.g., sentiment scores, correlation with assets, AI confidence).

3. **POST** `/api/analysis`  
   - Create a new analysis record (the pipeline might trigger this automatically).  
   - **Body**: references to news item, analysis fields, model metadata (which model version, confidence, etc.).

4. **PUT** `/api/analysis/:id` (or **PATCH**)  
   - Update or override AI results.  
   - **Body**: new/edited sentiment, confidence, or other fields that a human might override.

5. **DELETE** `/api/analysis/:id`  
   - Remove an analysis record (not always necessary—could be for clean-up or test data removal).

### Optional: Trigger Re-analysis
- **POST** `/api/news/:id/reanalyze`  
  - If you want a manual endpoint to re-run the AI pipeline for a specific news item.  
  - This might queue a background job to re-process the news with a new model, etc.

---

## 5. Asset Data & Prices

You might have a separate data set for assets (stock tickers, forex pairs, crypto, etc.). Provide CRUD for assets or at least read-only:

1. **GET** `/api/assets`  
   - List of tradable assets (tickers, names, etc.).  
   - **Query params**: type of asset, sector, region, etc.

2. **GET** `/api/assets/:id`  
   - Details for a specific asset, e.g., ticker info, sector, etc.

3. **POST** `/api/assets`  
   - Create a new asset in the system (if you need to dynamically add assets).

4. **PUT** `/api/assets/:id` (or **PATCH**)  
   - Update asset info (change name, sector, etc.).

5. **DELETE** `/api/assets/:id`  
   - Remove or deactivate an asset.

### Price History / Market Data
You’ll likely have time-series data for asset prices. This could be a separate endpoint:

- **GET** `/api/assets/:id/prices`  
  - Returns historical or real-time price data for an asset.  
  - **Query params**: date range, interval (1m, 1h, 1d), etc.

*(Alternatively, you might ingest prices from an external API and store them in a dedicated table.)*

---

## 6. Human Override / Annotation

You may want more detailed endpoints specifically for annotation or overriding the AI output at a granular level (especially if multiple analysts collaborate on a single analysis record):

1. **POST** `/api/analysis/:id/annotations`  
   - Add new annotation or note about the AI output (e.g., “The sentiment is off because the headline is sarcastic”).  
   - **Body**: `{ userId, annotationText, overrideSentiment, ... }`

2. **GET** `/api/analysis/:id/annotations`  
   - Retrieve all annotations for a specific analysis record.

3. **DELETE** `/api/analysis/:id/annotations/:annotationId`  
   - Remove an annotation.

---

## 7. Dashboards / Aggregations

Often, you’ll need endpoints that return aggregated data for dashboard views. For instance:

1. **GET** `/api/dashboards/newsStats`  
   - Returns aggregated metrics such as the count of news articles per day, average sentiment by asset, top 5 negative stories, etc.

2. **GET** `/api/dashboards/assetSentiment`  
   - Summarized sentiment for each asset or each sector.  
   - Could be used in charts showing sentiment trends over time.

3. **GET** `/api/dashboards/correlations`  
   - Could return correlation metrics between sentiment and asset price movements.

*(The exact shape of these routes depends on what your front-end needs to display. You might also place these under `/api/analysis/aggregates` or a similarly named endpoint.)*

---

## 8. Event / Notification Endpoints

If you intend to alert users in real-time about certain triggers (e.g., big sentiment drop, major news event):

1. **GET** `/api/alerts`  
   - List all active or historical alerts.  
   - **Query params**: unread, severity level, etc.

2. **POST** `/api/alerts`  
   - Create a manual alert (e.g., admin pushes a notice).

*(Or you might generate these alerts automatically via a separate microservice, but still store them for the UI in a DB and expose them via an API.)*

---

## 9. System / Health Check

For DevOps and deployment checks:

1. **GET** `/api/health`  
   - Returns some simple JSON like `{ status: "ok", uptime, dbConnection: "ok" }`.  

2. **GET** `/api/version`  
   - (Optional) Returns info about the deployed version, commit hash, etc.

---

## 10. Additional Considerations

- **Role-Based Authorization**: Some endpoints (like `DELETE /api/news/:id` or user management) should only be accessible to admins.  
- **WebSockets or SSE**: You might add a `/ws` or `/sse` endpoint if you want real-time pushes of new articles or price changes to the front-end.  
- **Batch Operations**: If you frequently update multiple records at once, consider adding endpoints like **PUT** `/api/news/batch` for bulk updates.  
- **Versioning**: If you expect frequent changes, prefix your routes with versions (`/api/v1/...`).

---

### Putting It All Together (Example Structure)

Below is an example of how you might organize your routes:

```
/api
  ├─ /auth
  │   ├─ POST /login
  │   ├─ POST /refresh
  │   └─ POST/DELETE /logout
  ├─ /users
  │   ├─ GET /
  │   ├─ GET /:id
  │   ├─ POST /
  │   ├─ PUT /:id
  │   └─ DELETE /:id
  ├─ /news
  │   ├─ GET /
  │   ├─ GET /:id
  │   ├─ POST /
  │   ├─ PUT /:id
  │   └─ DELETE /:id
  ├─ /analysis
  │   ├─ GET /
  │   ├─ GET /:id
  │   ├─ POST /
  │   ├─ PUT /:id
  │   └─ DELETE /:id
  ├─ /analysis/:analysisId/annotations
  │   ├─ GET /
  │   ├─ POST /
  │   └─ DELETE /:annotationId
  ├─ /assets
  │   ├─ GET /
  │   ├─ GET /:id
  │   ├─ POST /
  │   ├─ PUT /:id
  │   └─ DELETE /:id
  ├─ /assets/:id/prices (GET)
  ├─ /dashboards
  │   ├─ GET /newsStats
  │   ├─ GET /assetSentiment
  │   └─ GET /correlations
  ├─ /alerts
  │   ├─ GET /
  │   └─ POST /
  ├─ /health
  └─ /version
```

This structure covers most typical scenarios for a financial news + AI analysis application. You can then refine or remove endpoints that are unnecessary for your project.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Plan CRUD endpoints** for core entities: News items, Analysis results, Assets, Users.  
2. **Include specialized endpoints** for AI re-analysis, annotation, and dashboards/aggregations.  
3. **Enforce authentication & authorization** on each endpoint.  
4. **Version your API** if you anticipate iterative changes.  

This set of endpoints should give you a solid framework to start building your back-end and connecting it to your front-end dashboard.
